SublimeThemes
=============

Sublime Text themes that I have created for public personal use. 


Please feel free to use these Sublime Text themes to enhance your text editor. 


To install, 

Copy the file into:


C:\Users\(yourusername)\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\Color Scheme - Default


That is the folder as it appears on my Windows box. 

For more on installing, please see:
